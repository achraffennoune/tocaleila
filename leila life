To receive a gift, you need to go to the post office and press the transport container. After that, your gift will appear on the tape.If you don't want to create heroes yourself, you can use ready-made characters. At the bottom of the window, at the entrance to any building in the city, a panel with a choice of heroes will be at your disposal. There are several tabs here that have a selection of heroes"

			"description": "The location appeared relatively recently. It is an abandoned park, in the center of which is an old castle. At the park gate, a detective is sitting on a bench with some clues in his briefcase. A photo shows a lion statue with a button on it. Once inside the castle, you can see this statue at the elevator. Lower the lion's head to reveal a secret niche in the wall. In the niche you should take a picture, and also get a scroll from the box - this is a hint for you. On the ground floor is another painting in green tones (hanging on the wall to the right of the elevator). Put the clue, the safe picture, and the green picture in the elevator."
